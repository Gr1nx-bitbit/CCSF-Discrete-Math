    "Problem: In 1b, Pooh doesn’t explicitly state his conclusions, but he is drawing conclusions. What are they? Rewrite your formal-logic translation to show the implied conclusions. (For example, when Pooh says, “Now, the only reason for making a buzzing noise that I know of is because you are…a bee!”, we can translate this as “if it makes a buzzing noise, it’s a bee” but he’s concluding “therefore, it’s a bee.”)\n",

    "c. An inference rule is valid if it always produces true conclusions (if the statements leading up to the conclusions are true). For example, the inference rule used in 1a that if we know p, and we know p->q, then q must be true is valid. Explain why example iii proves that the inference rule used in 1c is not valid.\n",
    "    - just because p implies q, does not always mean that q is true if p is true e.g. a dog can have three legs but is still a dog, in that sence p does not imply q yet p -> q still produces a true result. In the same sense, an animal can have 4 legs and not be a dog such as cat, in this sense p -> q produces a false result since even though the animal has four legs (p) it is not a dog (q) but instead a cat. \n",
