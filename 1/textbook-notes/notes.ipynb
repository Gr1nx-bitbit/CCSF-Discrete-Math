    "*Formalism* is basically a way of boiling down sentences into the important nuggets of information they hold and describing the relationship between them (19). You can take a lot of the thinking out of a problem by using formalism since you're manipulating symbols and relationships instead of sifitng through every little detail, however you will need to *interpret* your results.
