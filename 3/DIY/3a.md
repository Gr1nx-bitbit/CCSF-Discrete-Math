# Axiomatic Systems and Concepts
Consider the following axiomatic system. We’ll call this axiomatic system the atom-set system.

#### Undefined terms: *atom*, *set*, *in*
##### axioms:
1. For every atom x, there’s a set y for which x is in y, and nothing but x is in y. (ATOMS ARE INSIDE OF SETS AND THERE IS AN SINGLE ATOM SET -- **ATOM SET PAIRS**)
2. If x and y are two different sets, they can’t have exactly the same atoms in them: there must be at least one atom z that is in x but not y, or that is in y but not x. (SETS MUST HAVE UNIQUE CONFIGURATIONS OF ATOMS BUT CAN SHARE ATOMS)
3. If x and y are two different sets, there is a set z such that all the atoms that are in x are in z, all the atoms that are in y are in z, and all the atoms in z are either in x or in y. (**Definition**: we call z the union of x and y if it satisfies these criteria.) (THERE IS AT LEAST ONE SET THAT HOLDS OTHER SETS IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SET)
4. If x and y are two different sets, there is a set z such that any atom a is in z if and only if it’s in both x and y. (**Definition**: we call z the intersection of x and y if it satisfies these criteria.) (IF TWO SETS SHARE AN ATOM, THERE IS A SET THAT SURROUNDS THEM)

##### 1. Prove that if A and B are two atoms, there is a set x such that A and B are both in x, and A and B are the only things in x.
Atoms must be in a set, but each unique atom must also have its own unique set. A has A' and  B has B', The set C holds both A' and B' via axiom 3.

##### 2. Construct a model of this system with one atom and one set.
