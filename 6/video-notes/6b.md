Remember, an Eurler path is one in which each edge is used exactly once. They only exist when the graph is connected, a vertex of odd degree has to be a start and or an end; if there are more than two vertecies of odd degree then there is no Euler path. If no vertecies of odd degree, then there is an Euler path starting and ending at the same point - which is also a circuit (starts and ends at the same point).
