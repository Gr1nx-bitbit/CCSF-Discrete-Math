#### 2 Topological sorting is an algorithm to put these courses in a linear order—i.e., for taking one course  per semester, such that  each course’s prerequisites occurs before it. Topological sorting works like this:
- a. We first pick a minimal element (i.e. a course with no prerequisites on the diagram, which we can take first). What are the minimal courses in this poset? (There are three.)
    - The minimal courses are Math 90, CS 110A, and CS 160A
- b. Pick one minimal element to list first; write it in the list.
    - Math 90
- c. Re-draw the Hasse diagram without the course you’ve already listed (and without any of the edges connecting it to other courses.)
- d. Repeat steps a-c.
- e. Continue until you’re done!
In my notebook, I'll have a pdf here.
