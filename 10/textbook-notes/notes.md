# Reading 4.1: Basic Counting Techniques
A **disjoint set** is one in which the union of two sets = Ø - usually either or type stuff. 

**Theorem 4.1** Suppose A1, A2, ..., An are pairwise disjoint sets, that is Ai ≠ Aj for all i and j with i ≠ j. Then A1∪A2∪...∪An = |A1| + |A2| + |...| + |An|. -- Proved by induction. 

<font color="green">We can always think of a Cartesian prodct A x B as a grid!</font>. The number of elements (ordered pairs) in a cross product of sets is |A|•|B|. You can represent cross products as trees - the root node is just a starting point then the children of the root are the elements in one of the sets and the children of the root's children are the elements in the second set - can be expanded to an n cross prodcut. 

**Theorem 4.2** Suppose A1, A2, ..., An are finite sets, then A1 x A2 x ... x An = |A1|•|A2|•|...|•|An|
