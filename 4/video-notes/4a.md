An **Euler Path** is a path that goes through every edge only once. If a graph has a vertex that only has a single edge, then if we you want an Euler path, that path either has to start or end at that vertex; this is because you can only use each edge once in an Euler path, therefore, you can't go to and away from a single vertex using different edges if it only has one (4:00). **This implictly means that if you have more than two odd degree vertecies, you CANNOT have an Euler path**. This is the **ONLY** restriction, besides a graph being connected, on whether a graph can have an Euler path or not (8:00)!
