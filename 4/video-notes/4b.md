# Products and Power Sets

You can have a product of sets: A x B. This makes an ordered pair of the element in A and B i.e. every element of A is paired with every element of B just how the cartesian coordiante system is **R** x **R**. You can have as many sets multiplied together which will result in ordered pairs, triplets, quadruplets; really just a tuple. 

X x Y = {(x, y) | x ∈ X, y ∈ Y}
|X x Y| = |X| x |Y|

**Power sets** are all the subsets of another set and the **caridnailty** of a set is the magnitude of the Power set. The cardinality of a set S ( |P(S)| ) is always |P(S)| = 2^(|S|).
