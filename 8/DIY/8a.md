Base case and recursive case given [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mOK5KaLXlvcUHdF2kPcJsl5jcMNNgN9dUkxG2q9Ptk4/edit?tab=t.0)

### 1 Let’s give a similar definition of a propositional formula. To start with, we can say that any variable name is a propositional formula. Write the recursive cases below (Hint: what are the “operations” in propositional logic that replace addition, multiplication, etc.?)
Operations include ->, <-->, ¬, ^, v

### 2 Recursive definitions can tell us what the building blocks of an object are. One way of representing this is with a tree, where the root is our final object and each recursive step sits atop the steps it’s built from. For example, here are the trees for the algebraic expressions e^(2sin(x+1)) and (3x - 5)(x^2 - 2) -- make trees for the propositional formulas p v (¬p ^ q) and (¬p) -> (r ^ (q v s))
                    p v (¬p ^ q)
                    /           \
                   p            (¬p ^ q)
                                /       \
                               ¬p        q
                               /
                              p

                        ¬p -> (r ^ (q v s))
                        /     /             \
                       p     r              q v s
                                           /     \
                                          q       s
