Janet borrows $12,000 on her credit card. Her credit card has a monthly interest rate of 1.5% and she makes a $200 payment each month. What this means is that each month, the credit card company looks at her last month’s balance and adds 1.5% of it, and then she pays them $200 which is subtracted from her balance. After 0 months her balance is $12,000. During month 1, her credit card company adds 1.5% of $12,000, which is $180, and then subtracts the $200 she pays them, leaving her with a balance of $12,000 + $180 - $200 = $11,980 at the end of month 

1. Calculate Janet’s balance at the end of month 2. (Note: the interest is calculated based on her month-1 balance of $11,980, so it’s slightly less than $180 in interest.)
    - $11,980 * 0.015 = 179.7, $11,980 + $179.80 - $200 = $11,959.70

2. Write a recurrence relation for the sequence Bn = Janet’s balance at the end of month n.
    - Ok so first we take the initial balance B(0) = 12000, then we multiply that quanitty B(0) by 0.015 add it to B(0) and then subtract 200. So B(1) = B(0) + B(0)(0.015) - 200, then wouldn't that just mean that B(n) = B(n-1) + B(n-1)(0.015) - 200; B(2) = B(1) + B(1)(0.015) - 200, B(1) = B(0) - B(0)(0.015) - 200 = 11980, B(2) = 11980 + (11980)(0.015) - 200 = 11,959.70, so that works

3. Calculate Janet’s balance at the end of month 5.
    - B(5) = B(4) + B(4)(0.015) - 200, not doing that :)

4. Make a rough estimate of how long it will take Janet to pay her balance down to $0. (One way to think about this: every month Janet’s balance goes down by a different amount, but each of those monthly decreases is at least $20 and at most $200.)
    - too much thinking in too little time

5. It’s really quite impractical to check your estimate by hand! Explain why, and suggest a way you might check your estimate.
    - we could get a computer to do it?
