#### 9 Consider the recurrence relation defined in Example 3.3. Suppose that, as in the example, you borrow $500, but you pay her back $100 each week. Each week, Ursula charges you 10% interest on the amount you still owe, after your $100 payment is taken into account.
The recurrence relation in example 3.3 is: 
M(n) {
    if n == 0 {
        500
    } else if n > 0{
        1.1 * M(n-1)
    }
}

- a. Write down a recurrence relation for M(n), the amount owed after n weeks.
    - So the first week would look like: M(1) = 1.1 * [M(0) - 100], so then the recurrence relation should be M(n) = 1.1 * [M(n-1) - 100]
    - if we were to use that for week 2 that would give us M(2) = 1.1 * [M(1) - 100], M(1) = 1.1 * 400 = 440, M(2) = 1.1 * 340 = 374.
    - lets do that by hand, we have 440 bucks owed by the end of week 1 so we subtract by 100 and then multiply by 1.1 so yes!
- b. How much will you owe after four weeks?
    - M(4)
