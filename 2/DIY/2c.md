# Predicate Logic Translations

## 1: Use the symbols R(x) = “x is red”, G(x) = “x is green”, and S(x,y) = “x and y are the same color” on the domain “shirts” to rewrite these sentences in English. For each sentence try to write it in as natural English as you can

a. Vx(R(x) -> ¬G(x)) == For all shirts, if the shirt is red, then the shirt is not green

b. ∃x(R(x) ^ G(x)) == Some shirts,are both green and red

c. ∃x(R(x) ^ (Vy)(S(x, y))) == There is some shirt, x, that is green and the same color as every other shirt, y.

d. (∃x)(Vy)(R(y) -> S(x, y)) == For all shirts (y), if the shirt is green, then there is a shirt another shirt (x) that is the same color

## 2: Two of the sentences you wrote in #1 contradict each other—which two, and why?

a and b contradict each other because a does not consider the possibility that a shirt can be BOTH red and green. It can only be true if a shirt is not green, or if the first shirt is not and red and the other shirt is green. 

## 3: Use the symbols P(x) = x is prime, G(x,y) = x is greater than y, and D(x,y) = x is a divisor of y to rewrite these sentences in predicate logic.

a. Every prime number is greater than y == (Vx)(P(x) ^ G(x, y))

b. There is a prime number greater than y == (∃x)(P(x) ^ G(x, y))

c. There is a greatest prime number == (∃x)(Vy)(P(x) ^ P(y) ^ G(x, y))

d. Every number is greater than all of its divisors == (Vx)(Vy)(D(x, y) ^ G(y, x))

e. For every prime number there is a greater prime == (Vx)(∃y)(P(x) ^ P(y) ^ G(y, x))

f. Prime numbers have no divisors == (Vx)(P(x) ^ ¬D(y, x))

## 4: Not doing it

## 5: Two of the sentences you wrote in #3 contradict each other—which two, and why?
a and c are contradictory because you can't have a greatest number AND a number greater than it i.e. there is no greatest number
