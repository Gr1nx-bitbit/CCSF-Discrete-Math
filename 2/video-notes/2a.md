# Video 2a: Propositional Logic

Tautologies help us conclude things through inference. We can split up statements into smaller bits or rewrite them in another
form to help us infer and conclude certain logic i.e. if (p -> q) ^ r is true, it's safe to conclude p -> q is true

For proof sequences we can set up a two colomn table with statements that are true and the reason for that statement being true
A proof sequence for p -> (q v r) => (p ^ ¬q) -> r would look like so:

(p ^ ¬q) -> r <=> ¬(p ^ ¬q) v r <=> ¬p v q v r <=> (¬p v q) v r <=> r v (p ^ ¬q)  

|Statement|Reason|
|:-------:|:----:|
|p -> (q v r)|Given|
|¬p v (q v r)|Implications can be rewritten like so|
